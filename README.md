Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a line of three matching symbols (typically X or O) either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

How to play Tic Tac Toe:
The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
Two players take turns, with one playing X and the other playing O.
The first player (X) places their symbol in an empty square of the grid.
The second player (O) then places their symbol in another empty square.
The players continue taking turns, each placing their symbol in an empty square until either one of them wins or the game ends in a tie.
A player wins if they successfully get three of their symbols in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
If all the squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.

Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet strategic game that serves as a good introduction to basic game concepts and decision-making.
